```
    - Expectation: test < 500
    - Result:


2. Workflow should have no instances in progress that where started before one year ago
    - Test:
```sql
SELECT count(*) 
FROM wf_instance 
WHERE wf_start <= DATEADD(year, -1, GETDATE())
and wf_status in ('I', 'R', 'A', 'P')
```
    - Expectation: test = 0 
    - Result:



3. Workflow should have no in progress instances on inactive models
    - Test:
```sql
SELECT count(t2.unique_key)
FROM
    (SELECT wf_model_id, wf_version FROM wf_model WHERE wf_status <> 'A') AS t1
    INNER JOIN
    (SELECT * FROM wf_instance WHERE wf_status in ('I', 'R', 'A', 'P')) AS  t2
    ON t1.wf_model_id = t2.wf_model_id
WHERE t1.wf_version = t2.wf_version
```
    - Expectation: test = 0
    - Result:



4. Workflow instances in progress should have at least one pending history record
    - Test:
```sql
SELECT count(*)
FROM wf_instance
WHERE wf_status = 'I'
AND wf_key NOT IN (

    FROM wf_history
    WHERE wf_status = 'P'
)
```
    - Expectation: test = 0
    - Result:



5. Workflow Users should be enabled using 'Y' and not 'W'

    - Result: 



6. Users should have a default GL ledger
    - Test:
```sql

    - Expectation: test should not have null or blank value
    - Result:



7. Users should have a default JL ledger
    - Test:
